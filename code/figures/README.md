### Figures repository

This folder contains five Python scripts:
  *  **fig2.py        :** Code to construct figure 2: A) Raster plot; B) box plot of firing rates;
                          C) barplot of CV's; D) barplot of synchrony index.  
  *  **fig5.py        :** Code to construct figure 5: A1 and B1 Raster plots of network activity;
		          A2 and B2 barplots of firing rates
  *  **fig6_data.py        :** Calculation of the %AIness index used to construct figure 6; 
  *  **fig6_graph.py        :** Code to construct figure 6: A) firing rate vs background rate; B) 				        Colorgraph  with AIness%; C) firing rate vs relative inhibitory 				synaptic strength
  *  **ks_test.py        :** P-value calculated with Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic.
			     Figures with cummulated histograms of firing rate and CV's
